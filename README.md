arduino dungeon crawler project

The game "mimics" a dungeon crawler RPG where your main goal is to find keys in a labyrinth. After you’ve found a set number of keys, the game creates a gateway towards to next level (dungeon). The gateway is created randomly after you’ve found all keys so you have to find that as well.
